# Punchlist

![demo]('readmeAttachments/Punchlist.gif')

This is an ultra-basic non-javascript-tooled version of a punchlist using [Vue.js](http://www.vuejs.org) for MVVM.

I'm using this as an intro for my meetup presentation on [Building modern Javascript Apps with Node, Gulp, Vue, Browerify, and Sass](http://www.meetup.com/SaintLouis_FullStack_WebDevelopment/events/229544984/).
