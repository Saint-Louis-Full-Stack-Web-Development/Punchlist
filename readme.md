# Punchlist

![demo]('readmeAttachments/Punchlist.gif')

This is an ultra-basic non-javascript-tooled version of a punchlist using [Vue.js](http://www.vuejs.org) for MVVM.

I'm using this as an intro for my meetup presentation on [Building modern Javascript Apps with Node, Gulp, Vue, Browerify, and Sass](http://www.meetup.com/SaintLouis_FullStack_WebDevelopment/events/229544984/).

## Get up and running

The easiest way (from my perspective) to get this up and running is to just launch a php ad-hoc server to host the web app. If you don't have or don't want to use php, you just need to clone this project into a folder at the web-root of your web server.

- Clone this repo:

        cd ~/Desktop && git clone https://github.com/chris-schmitz/Punchlist.git punchlist

- `cd` into the `punchlist` folder:

        cd punchlist

- Launch a php ad-hoc server:

        php -S localhost:8001

- Open a web browser to `http://localhost:8001`
